# Python Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analyzer
This project is a command-line tool written in Python for performing Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis on companies using historical financial data
loaded from an Excel file. It's manual rather than "automatic". It calculates 
a range of estimated intrinsic values based on user-defined assumptions and incorporates a margin of safety, inspired by value investing principles (Benjamin Graham's The Intelligent Investor).
This tool was developed as a personal project to code something cool and apply basic financial concepts. The "Qualitative Analysis" section was also included to remind myself
of important qualitative features of companies (inspired from "The essays of Warren Buffett"), not just purely quantitative. 


## Limitations / Future Improvements
This project is a very basic framework. It is very manual and relies a lot on user input.


## Other 
DCF.py is the main file, DCF.ipynb was used for testing.
